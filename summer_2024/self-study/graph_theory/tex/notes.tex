\subsection*{Basic Definitions}

\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{graph} $G$ is an object consisting of two sets called its \textit{vertex set} and its \textit{edge set}. The vertex set is a finite nonempty set. The edge set may be empty, but otherwise its elements are two-element subsets of the vertex set.
